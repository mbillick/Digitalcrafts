// inside the function block create 2 variables; 1 string and another number: currentMonth and currentYear

// ex. Hello! My name is firstName lastName < pass in your parameters
// ex. The date is the currentDate of currentMonth, currentYear
// ex. I am currently learning how to program in programming language
// ex. Change the value of the programming language variable
// Add a console.log to output programming language 
// ex. And I'm learning language
// ex. I now know how to make a variables and functions
// exit out of the function
// console.log a global scoped variable; i.e. a variable not defined in a code block
// console.log a local scoped variable defined in the function block
